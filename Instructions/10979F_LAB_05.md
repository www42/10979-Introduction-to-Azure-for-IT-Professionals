# Module 5: Creating and configuring virtual networks
# Lab: Create and configure virtual networks
  
### Scenario
  
Adatum Corporation plans to deploy a number of Azure virtual machines in a load-balanced configuration. You plan to create a virtual network and configure an Azure load balancer to test this plan. 

### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create virtual networks
- Provision Azure load balancers

    > **Note**: The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab Setup
  
Estimated Time: **30 minutes**

Virtual machine: **10979F-MIA-CL1**

User name: **Admin**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

For this lab, you need to use the available VM environment. Before you begin the lab, you must complete the following steps:

1. On the host computer, start **Hyper-V Manager**.

1. In Hyper-V Manager, click **10979F-MIA-CL1**, and then in the **Actions** pane, click **Start**.

1. In the **Actions** pane, click **Connect**. Wait until the VM starts. 

1. Sign in by using the following credentials: 

    - User name: **Admin**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd**

1. You also need to start **MT17B-WS2016-NAT** for Internet access.


## Exercise 1: Creating a virtual network
  
### Scenario
  
You start by creating a new virtual network by using the Azure portal and deploying Azure virtual machines into this virtual network.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a virtual network by using Azure Portal

1. Create the first Azure VM in an availability set by using Azure Portal

1. Create the second Azure VM in an availability set by using Azure Portal


#### Task 1: Create a virtual network by using the Azure portal
  
1. From MIA-CL1, start Microsoft Edge, go to [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com), and then, if prompted, sign in to the Azure portal as the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.

1. From the Azure portal, create a new virtual network by using the following settings:

    - Name: **labVNet1**

    - Address space: **10.0.0.0/16**

    - Subnet name: **subnet0**

    - Subnet address range: **10.0.0.0/24**

    - Subscription: the name of the target Azure subscription

## Exercise 2: Configuring load balancing of Azure VMs
  
### Scenario
  
After creating the Azure virtual networks, you want to deploy two virtual machines into them and ensure that they can communicate directly by using their private IP addresses.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Deploy an Azure load balancer

1. Configure the Azure load balancer

1. Test Azure load balancing

1. Prepare for the next module


#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure load balancer
  
1. On MIA-CL1, from the Azure portal, create an Azure load balancer with the following settings:

    - Name: **10979F0501-ilb**

    - Type: **Public**
  
    - SKU: **Basic**

    - Public IP address: a new public IP address resource named **10979F0501-ilb-pip**

    - Assignment: **Dynamic**

    - Subscription: the same Azure subscription into which you deployed the virtual network in the first exercise of this lab

    - Resource group: **10979F0501-LabRG**

    - Location: the same the Azure region in which you created the virtual network in the first exercise of this lab.

1. Wait for the deployment to complete.


#### Task 2: Configure the Azure load balancer

1. Configure the newly created load balancer with the backend pool named **10979F0501-ilb-bepool** and associate it to the availability set **10979F0501-avSet** with **ipconfig1** of **10979F0501-vm** and **ipconfig1* of **10979F0502-vm**.

1. Configure the load balancer with the health probe that has the following settings:

    - Name: **10979F0501-ilb-probetcp3389**

    - Protocol: **TCP**

    - Port: **3389**

    - Interval: **5**

    - Unhealthy threshold: **2**

1. Configure the load balancer with the following load balancing rule: 

    - Name: **10979F0501-ilb-ruletcp3389**

    - IP Version: **IPv4**

    - Frontend IP address: **LoadBalancerFrontEnd**

    - Protocol: **TCP**

    - Port: **3389**

    - Backend port: **3389**

    - Backend Pool: **10979F0501-ilb-bepool (2 virtual machines)**

    - Probe: **10979F0501-ilbprobetcp3389 (TCP:3389)**

    - Session persistence: **None**

    - Idle timeout: **4**

    - Floating IP (direct server return): **Disabled**

1. On the 10979F0501-ilb blade, review the **Essentials** section and identify the public IP address assigned to the load balancer. 

    > **Note**: This configuration will allow you to connect to either of two Azure VMs via RDP even though neither of them has directly assigned public IP address. The Azure VMs in this configuration can host as highly available jump hosts for connections to other Azure VMs within the same Azure virtual network.


#### Task 3: Test Azure load balancing

1. From the Azure portal, identify the IP address of the **10979F0501-ilb** load balancer.

1. From MIA-CL1, start a Remote Desktop session targeting the IP address of the load balancer.

1. Identify the Azure VM that you connected to via the Remote Desktop session. 

1. From the Remote Desktop sessions to the Azure VM, shut down its operating system. This will automatically terminate the Remote Desktop session.

1. From MIA-CL1, start a Remote Desktop session targeting the IP address of the load balancer.

1. Identify the Azure VM that you connected to via the Remote Desktop session. Note that you were automatically redirected to the other Azure VM.

1. Close all open windows.


#### Task 4: Prepare for the next module
  
1. From MIA-CL1, start Microsoft Edge, browse to [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com), and, if prompted, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.

1. From the Azure Portal, delete the **10979F0501-LabRG** resource group.

1. Close Microsoft Edge.

When you are finished with the lab, do not revert the virtual machines. Please keep all of the VMs running. The VMs in their current state are required for the next module.

> **Result**: Once you completed this exercise, you have deployed an Azure load balancer and tested its functionality. 


**Question** 
Can you move virtual machines that you created in the lab to a different virtual network?

**Question** 
By default, can you successfully ping a Windows Server 2016 virtual machine on a virtual network?
