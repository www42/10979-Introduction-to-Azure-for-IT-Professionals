> **Note**: This configuration will allow you to connect to either of two Azure VMs via RDP even though neither of them has directly assigned public IP address. The Azure VMs in this configuration can host as highly available jump hosts for connections to other Azure VMs within the same Azure virtual network.


#### Task 3: Test Azure load balancing

1. On MIA-CL1, right-click **Start**, click **Run**, in the **Open** text box, type the following and press Enter (replace the placeholder `<10979F0501-ilb-pip>` with the IP address you identified in the previous step):

   ```
   mstsc /f /admin /v:<10979F0501-ilb-pip>
   ```

1. When prompted for credentials, type **Student** in the **User name** text box, **Pa55w.rd1234** in the **Password** text box, and click **OK**.

1. When prompted to confirm that you want to connect even though the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified, click **Yes**.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session, in the **Server Manager** window, click **Local Server** and identify the value of the **Computer name** entry.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session, click **Start**, click the **Power** icon, and then click **Shut down**.

1. In the **Choose a reason that best describess why you want to shut down this computer** drop down list, select **Other (Planned)** and click **Continue**. This will automatically terminate the Remote Desktop session.

   ```
   mstsc /f /admin /v:<10979F0501-ilb-pip>
   ```

1. When prompted to confirm that you want to connect even though the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified, note the name in the certificate from the remote computer and verify that this is the other Azure VM. Click **Yes**.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session, in the **Server Manager** window, click **Local Server** and identify the value of the **Computer name** entry. Note that you were automatically redirected to the other Azure VM.

1. Close all open windows.


#### Task 4: Prepare for the next module
  
1. From MIA-CL1, start Microsoft Edge, browse to [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com), and, if prompted, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.
